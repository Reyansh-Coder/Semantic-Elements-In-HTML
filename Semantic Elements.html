                    <h3> <center> Astronomy: A Journey Through the Cosmos</center></h3>
                    <p> Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and the universe at large. As one of the oldest
                    sciences, astronomy dates back thousands of years, rooted in ancient cultures that used the night sky for practical and
                    ceremonial purposes. Early civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks, and Mayans, observed celestial
                    bodies to establish calendars, navigate vast distances, and predict seasonal changes. Over millennia, our understanding
                    of the universe has evolved from the geocentric model of the Earth at the center of everything to the current model,
                    where Earth is but one planet in a vast and expanding universe.
                    
                    The objects studied in astronomy are diverse and fascinating. Stars are among the most critical elements in astronomy;
                    these massive, glowing spheres of plasma, like our Sun, burn through nuclear fusion, producing light and heat. Stars
                    vary greatly in size, temperature, and lifespan, ranging from small, cool red dwarfs to supermassive, extremely hot
                    stars. As stars exhaust their fuel, they undergo transformations, with some collapsing into white dwarfs, neutron stars,
                    or even black holes—regions of space where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape. Planets orbit
                    stars, and our solar system is home to eight planets, including Earth. Planets can be rocky (like Earth and Mars) or gas
                    giants (like Jupiter and Saturn), and their moons, such as our own Moon or the icy moons of Jupiter, offer a window into
                    planetary formation and evolution. Smaller celestial bodies like asteroids and comets also play essential roles.
                    Asteroids, made of rock and metal, often originate in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, while comets, composed
                    of ice and dust, develop spectacular tails when they approach the Sun.
                    
                    Galaxies are the largest structures in the universe, containing billions to trillions of stars. Our galaxy, the Milky
                    Way, is a barred spiral galaxy housing roughly 100 billion stars, including our solar system. Astronomers have
                    classified galaxies into various types—spiral, elliptical, and irregular—each with unique properties. Beyond individual
                    galaxies lies the cosmic web, a vast, intricate structure that maps out the large-scale organization of matter in the
                    universe, including galaxy clusters and superclusters. Galaxies are not static; they move, collide, and merge over time,
                    a process observed in systems like the Andromeda Galaxy, which is on a collision course with the Milky Way in about 4.5
                    billion years. </p>

                    <p> While astronomy is a science focused on understanding the physical universe, astrology is an ancient belief system that
                    suggests a relationship between the positions of celestial bodies and human events. Many ancient cultures, including the
                    Babylonians, Greeks, and Chinese, practiced astrology, believing that the alignment of stars and planets could influence
                    an individual's fate or personality. Though astrology was once intertwined with early astronomical studies, the two
                    fields have since diverged significantly. Today, astrology is considered a pseudoscience, while astronomy remains a
                    rigorously tested scientific discipline. Despite this, astrology still enjoys cultural popularity and is often featured
                    in horoscopes and zodiac signs.</p>
